# Solarized Dark Apparent UI theme

Based on [Spacegray Dark UI](https://github.com/cannikin/spacegray-dark-ui) and [Solarized Dark UI](https://github.com/Rnhmjoj/solarized-dark-ui) Atom themes.
A successor to the original [Solarized Dark Apparent UI](https://github.com/joshnroy/solarized-dark-apparent-ui) as updating that package became bugged.
